# Lending-Club-Case-Study-Assignment
> The company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 
Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
To develop your understanding of the domain, you are advised to independently research a little about risk analytics (understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough).

## General Information
- Solving this assignment will give you an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques you have learnt in EDA, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
-You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, 
 the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
 If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
 If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
 The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person 
 is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest 
 rate, etc.
- As per the requirement, we met the below Results Expected
    - Write the code in one well-commented Python file; briefly mention the insights and observations from the analysis 
    - Present the overall approach of the analysis in a presentation: 
    - Mentioned the problem statement and the analysis approach briefly 
    - Explained the results of univariate, bivariate analysis etc. in business terms
    - Included visualisations and summarise the most important results in the presentation.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: We clearly undeterstand the given input data file. 
- Conclusion 2: We applied the filter for Data cleaning (cleaning missing values, removing redundant columns etc.)
- Conclusion 3: We did the Data Analysis & Generated various visulization reports for better understanding, easy to view the various reports status/updates.
